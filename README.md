**Hutel** is a personal habit tracker, made with React.

To run the project, grab the latest [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and run

```Shell
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

in the /server folder.

To run the tests, execute

```Shell
dotnet test
```

in the /server.test folder.


## Usage

The server acts as a storage for data points, which are validated against the corresponding tags from the `tags.json` file. Each point must contain a tag id, date and all of the fields required by its tag. There are six field types supported: int, float, string, date, time, enum.

Examples of the points (rename `tags.json.example` to `tags.json` for successful validation):

```JSON
{
    "tagId": "pushups",
    "date": "2016-12-11",
    "sets": 5,
    "total": 130
}
```

```JSON
{
    "tagId": "enoughsleep",
    "date": "2016-12-12",
    "value": "no"
}
```

```JSON
{
    "tagId": "vacation",
    "date": "2016-12-17",
    "location": "Mars",
    "endDate": "2016-12-31"
}
```

```JSON
{
    "tagId": "run",
    "date": "2017-01-01",
    "km": 42.0,
    "time": "02:34:11"
}
```

## Methods

* POST `/api/points` with point in the body adds a new point to the storage, validating it against corresponding tag
* GET `/api/points` returns the entire storage contents
* GET `/api/points?startDate=yyyy-mm-dd` returns all points that were added on or after specified date
* PUT `/api/points` overwrites the entire storage, the body format is the same as result of the previous method; all points are validated against tags, if any single one doesn't pass validation, storage is not modified
* PUT `/api/point/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` overwrites the point with specified id; the new point must include the same tag id as the old one
* GET `/api/tags` returns the entire tags config contents
* PUT `/api/tags` overwrites the entire tags config, the body format is the same as result of the previous method; all existing points are validated against the new tags, if any given one doesn't pass validation, tags config is not modified

## Authentication

Basic authentication and Google authentication is supported.

To use the basic authentication, set the environment variables (example for Windows):

```Batchfile
set HUTEL_USE_BASIC_AUTH=1
set HUTEL_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=user
set HUTEL_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd
```

To use the Google authentication, set the environment variables (example for Windows):

```Batchfile
set HUTEL_USE_GOOGLE_AUTH=1
set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=(your project id in Google Cloud)
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=(your client id)
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=(your client secret)
```

## Storage

Hutel supports three options for storing data:

* Local storage - tags.json and storage.json in current working directory act as underlying storage, used by default
* Google Cloud Storage - data is stored in cloud blobs, used instead of the local storage if environment variable `HUTEL_USE_GOOGLE_STORAGE` is set
* Google Drive Storage - data is stored in users' Google Drive storage. Requires Google authentication

### Provisioning Google Storage

Create a new project in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)

Add a Storage bucket called `hutel-storage`

### Setting up Google Storage on a local machine

Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

Open Google Cloud SDK Shell, choose an appropriate project and run

```Shell
gcloud beta auth application-default login
```

After logging in, set the environment variable in the same command window (example for Windows):

```Batchfile
set HUTEL_USE_GOOGLE_STORAGE=1
```

All done, you can now run the server with `dotnet run`

### Setting up Google Storage on a remote machine

Go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) - hamburger menu - API Manager - Credentials - Create Credentials - Service account key and create a new service account with Storage Object Admin as a role. The private key will be downloaded on your computer upon creation.

Copy the key to the remote machine and assign its path to environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

Set the environment variable `HUTEL_USE_GOOGLE_STORAGE`

All done, you can now run the server with `dotnet run`

### Enabling Google Drive Storage

To use Google Drive storage, enable Google authentication and set the environment variable (example for Windows):

```Batchfile
set HUTEL_USE_GOOGLE_DRIVE=1
```

Tags and points will be stored in `Hutel` folder in the root of the Drive.
